## Arduino IDE Setup Instructions
In order to run the Arduino code, you'll need to install the USB Shield library:

1. Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries
2. Search for "USB Host Shield Library 2.0"
3. Click to select list item, then click "Install"

If you get errors about missing "Xboxrecv" or similar, this is probably the problem.
